			When to use DP
How to solve an algorithm problem?

Half of the battle in interview
- Figuring out how to even approach the problem

When to use DP?
The problem can be broken down into "overlapping subproblems" 
- smaller versions of the original problem that are re-used multiple times

The problem has an "optimal substructure" 
- an optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions to the overlapping 
subproblems of the original problem

Note: Unfortunately, it is hard to identify when a problem fits into these definitions.
